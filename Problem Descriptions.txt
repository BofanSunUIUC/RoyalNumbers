An ordinal number is a word representing rank or sequential order. 
The name convention for royal names is to follow a frist name with an ordinal number, 
which is essentially a Roman numeral used to indicate the birth order of two people having the same name.

Complete the getSortedList function. It has 1 paramter: an array of royal name strins, names. 
Each royal name sting consists of a first name, followed by a single space, follewed by a Roman numeral. 
Your function must sort the names lexicographically (alphabetically) by first name; 
if two or more first names are the same, it must sort those duplicate first names by ascending ordinal number. 
It must then return the sorted array of royal name strings.
